# Traffic Behavior Pipeline

This project detects and tracks vehicles using YOLOv8 and ByteTrack, assigns them to lanes, estimates their speed, and predicts behaviors like lane changes.

## Pipeline Modules
1. Object Detection (YOLOv8)
2. Tracking (ByteTrack)
3. Lane Detection
4. Speed Estimation
5. Lane Change Detection
6. Behavior Prediction (LSTM or rules)
7. Visualization & Annotation
